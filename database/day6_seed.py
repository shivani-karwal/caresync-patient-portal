# CareSync Day 6 Data Seeder
#
# Adds two new tables:
#   doctor_rating  -- patient satisfaction scores per doctor per month
#   monthly_summary -- pre-aggregated monthly stats for the dashboard
#
# Safe to run on an existing caresync database.
# Does NOT touch doctor, patient, appointment, or billing tables.
